# Stair-Light-System
# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Stair Lighting System using Arduino UNO  This project is a smart stair lighting system designed using Arduino UNO. It detects a person approaching the stairs using IR sensors and lights up the stair LEDs one by one to enhance visibility, aesthetics, and energy efficiency.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code

The code is available in the `stair_lighting.ino` file. It is well-commented for easy understanding and modification.

üìù How It Works
IR sensor detects motion at the bottom of the stairs.

The microcontroller (Arduino UNO) triggers LEDs in sequence.

Lights stay ON for a few seconds and then turn OFF automatically.

Reverse triggering can be set for descending movement.

```cpp
// Example Code Snippet
if (digitalRead(sensor1) == HIGH) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numLEDs; i++) {
        digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
        delay(200);
    }
}
